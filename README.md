**NOTE: Flex 2 v1.3.0 broke compatibility with the default mapping format (thanks, Clownacy), so it is recommended you use 1.2.2 for editing or viewing.**

A disassembly of the November 3, 1993 prototype of _Sonic the Hedgehog 3_ for the Sega Genesis, based on Esrael's disassembly. Currently compiles into a bit-perfect ROM, although it is still very early on with documentation and organization. Runs using the Macro AS assembler, allowing for a complete decompilation of the sound driver used by the build.

Special Thanks:
* Esrael - original disassembly
* NyperYughard - improved upon Esrael's disassembly, which this was forked from
* Naoto - help with Z80 driver decompilation
* Totally-Not-Filter - forked disassembly
